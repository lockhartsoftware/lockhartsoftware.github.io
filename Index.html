              Hi Gavin,

I think these are the features (below) that we require, and suprise, surprise, they are already available with Azure API Management: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/#features

I've summarised the features as follows:


Manage APIs across clouds and on-premise using Self-hosted gateway: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/self-hosted-gateway-overview


Selectively expose data and services to employees, partners, and customers by applying authentication, authorization, and usage limits. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/transform-api


Build apps faster and deliver immediate value to your customers through API-first approaches. Decouple front- and back-end teams through API mocking, API revisions and versioning, and automating API documentation.


API Management Developer Portal

Create a customizable developer portal for all your APIs. Easily share APIs with internal teams, external partners, and customers. Using API Management Developer Portal https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-developer-portal

Developer portal is an automatically generated, fully customizable website with the documentation of your APIs. It is where API consumers can discover your APIs, learn how to use them, request access, and try them out.

Your API Management service includes a built-in, always up-to-date, managed developer portal. You can access it from the Azure portal interface.

If you need to extend it with custom logic, which isn't supported out-of-the-box, you can modify its codebase. The portal's codebase is available in a GitHub repository https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal

i.e., you can self-host the resulting portal outside of your API Management service.

How to publish your APIs with the new developer portal in Azure API Management https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday/How-to-publish-your-APIs-with-the-new-developer-portal-in-Azure-API-Management


Automatically turn legacy web services into modern REST-based APIs by creating façades for your back-end services.


Connect on-premises APIs to cloud services by creating a façade that lets you safely integrate on-premises and cloud environments.


And this, really excites me: Generate a new function app from an OpenAPI specification https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/generate-a-new-function-app-from-an-openapi-specification/
